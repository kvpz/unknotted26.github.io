I assume that the reader of this post already knows the basics about objects and classes, structs, and interfaces.
This post will dive into their nitty-gritty details.

# Access Modifiers
An access modifier is a keyword assigned to classes, structs, interfaces, and member data to warrant where it may be used in the codebase. More details with examples later. First I'd like to introduce some important keywords.
*public*: When code is refered to as public, it means that it can be accessed anywhere within the codebase or assemblies (that use its namespace).
####protected:
####private:
####internal:

# Inheritance
